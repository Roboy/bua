\section{Abstract}

A major challenge in the development of Natural Language Dialog Systems is to determine the intent of a user utterance, and to map the intent of an utterance U to a certain dialog application state T.
While recent work in this area focuses on embedding these variables as Neural-Network generated latent representations, we hypothesize that a symbolic approach to Dialog State tracking might deliver higher utility with reduced development effort:
By observing dialog system state as words out of a formal language over signals in the application context, with application states acting as contextual non-terminals, we set up a basic formal framework for dialog state propagation.
Futhermore, we propose the notion of constraint-based Bayesian state specificity as utility to resolve conflicts between overlapping application states. We implement our system in the open-source library "Ravestate".
Experiments with the implemented system both in text- and speech based scenarios with additional video input show very robust contextual behavior, while operating fully causally explainable and transparently.
